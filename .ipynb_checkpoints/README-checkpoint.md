# leaflet-challenge
Visualizing United States Geological Survey's earthquake data using Leaflet.js. Interactive full page map that explores weekly earthquake events reported by the USGS. Data should reflect live data as given by the USGS at the following: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

# Requirements
The project reuires the use of Leaflet.Js, which needs an api key to run. Earthquake data is public and readily available. 

# Future additions 
I would like to add the ability to have the user select if they want to view data from the past hour, day, week, or month.
